## Using the tool:

The Gallery Image Manager tool has two flows:

1. Take a collection of images to create a gallery image and a static class used to draw the image parts.
2. Take the gallery image and the generated static class code to split the gallery image into the individual images it contains.

This two functionalities allows for efficient management of the gallery image: adding, removing and changing.
